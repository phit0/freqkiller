Description: The function executes the Metropolis Hashtings Algorithm, where a Normal proposal density
              based on prior information and the current beta is generated (and updated) by means of iteratively
              weighted least squares. A random sample from the proposal density is then evaluated according to
              the loglikelihood, log-prior distribution and conditional proposal density compared to the previous
              beta. If the new value performs good enough, it has a higher chance to be stored in the chain of
              betas. If rejected, the current beta is stored in the chain and the algorithm proceeds to the next iteration..
