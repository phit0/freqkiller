Description: Frequentistkiller is a package that allows to fit a multivariate 
  generalized linear model for Bernoulli (link = logit), Normal and Poisson 
  (link = log) distributed response variables, including prior asumptions about 
  the regression parameter. Parameters are sampled from a normal proposal density 
  constructed via IWLS during the iterations of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and
  returned as a chain of close-to independent parameters. Their distribution  
  converges to the true posterior distribution of the parameters for infinite 
  iterations.
